# wordpress-maintenance
A Shell script to enable/disable the maintenance mode of wordpress quickly.
This will probably not be that useful since it is my first shellscript, however I will leave this here just in case someone needs it.


How to use:
1. Download the script by using: wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Steath/wordpress-maintenance/master/wp-maintenance.sh
2. Set the path to your wordpress installation: nano wp-maintenance.sh
3. Exectue the Script with your desired parameters.

List of parameters:

-h or --help           show this help

-e or --enable         enable wordpress maintenance mode

-d or --disable        disable wordpress maintenance mode
